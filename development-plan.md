    /categories (expense categories)
    /auth (authentication logic)
    /common (shared utilities, guards, filters)
    /config (environment configuration)
  ```

  - PATCH /api/v1/users/profile
- Implement profile information in PostgreSQL
- Set up auth guards for protected routes

**Mobile Authentication Screens**
- Design and implement login screen
- Create registration form with validation
- Build password reset screen
- Implement secure token storage using Expo SecureStore
- Create authenticated route protection

**Definition of Done**
- Users can register, login, and reset passwords
- Authentication flow works end-to-end
- JWT tokens are securely stored and transmitted

##### 3. Core Expense Tracking Functionality (Week 3-5)

**Database Models**
- Design and implement Expense schema with Prisma
- Create Category schema for expense categorization
- Set up relationships between User and Expenses
- Implement soft delete functionality

**API Endpoints**
- Create CRUD operations for expenses:
  - POST /api/v1/expenses - Create new expense
  - GET /api/v1/expenses - List expenses with pagination, sorting and filtering
  - GET /api/v1/expenses/:id - Get specific expense details
  - PATCH /api/v1/expenses/:id - Update expense
  - DELETE /api/v1/expenses/:id - Delete expense
- Implement category endpoints:
  - GET /api/v1/categories - List available categories
  - POST /api/v1/categories - Create custom category
  - PATCH /api/v1/categories/:id - Update custom category
  - DELETE /api/v1/categories/:id - Delete custom category
- Add proper validation using DTOs
- Implement authorization checks for data access

**Mobile UI Implementation**
- Create expense listing screen with filtering options
- Build expense detail view
- Implement expense creation form
- Add expense editing functionality
- Create category selection component
- Implement basic dashboard with expense summaries

**Definition of Done**
- All CRUD operations work for expenses and categories
- Data validation is implemented on both client and server
- Authorization ensures users only access their own data
- Mobile UI allows smooth interaction with expense data
- Basic dashboard shows expense summary information

##### 4. Offline Capabilities (Week 5-6)

**Local Storage Implementation**
- Set up AsyncStorage for simple offline data
- Configure store structure for offline data
- Implement data synchronization logic

**Offline-First Architecture**
- Create queue for pending API operations
- Implement background synchronization when online
- Add conflict resolution strategy
- Display visual indicators for unsynchronized data

**Definition of Done**
- App functions without internet connection
- Data created offline synchronizes when connection is restored
- Users can see sync status of their data
- No data loss occurs during sync process

##### 5. UI/UX Implementation (Week 6-7)

**Navigation Structure**
- Implement tab-based navigation
- Create navigation flows for all main features
- Add animations and transitions
- Ensure type safety in navigation
